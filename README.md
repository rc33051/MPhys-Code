# MPhys-Code
This Repository is an implementation of the LÃ¼scher Zeta function according to the Kim, Sachrajda and Sharpe. Furthermore it (taylor) expands this function about its unitary points, which are the points of infinite interaction strength, which is where the function itself is zero. This hopefully allows for faster evaluation of the function.
